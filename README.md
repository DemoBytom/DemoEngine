**DemoEngine** is a simple game engine written in C#, .NET Core 3.0 and DirectX.

Engine is currently developed for Windows 10 platform, with references to `Windows.Forms` and DirectX, but the code outside of those, should work wherever .NET Core 3.0 works. A provided layer of abstraction over platform specific codebase should make it possible to add cross platform later. 

Project is using [Vortice.Windows](https://github.com/amerkoleci/Vortice.Windows) as a DirectX wrapper, with parts of the main form handling based on [SharpDX](https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX/blob/master/Source/SharpDX.Desktop/RenderForm.cs)
